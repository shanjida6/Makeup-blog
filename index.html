        My current favorite foundation is the "Velvet Matte Skin Tint Broad 
        Spectrum SPF 30" by Nars cosmetics. This foundation retails for $45. 
        It comes in a variety of shades. The color that matches me is called
        Cuzco. Although this foundation is a skin tint, it acts as a foundation. 
        It gives low to medium coverage and can be buildable to full coverage. 
        The reason why I love this foundation so much is because it feels very 
        light on the skin. Almost as if no foundation was applied. I also love
        that this foundation is long wearing. I notice that when I go to events,
        the foundation will not fade at all. Overall, it's a great pick.

        A couple days ago, Sephora had their VIB sale which means that they were 
        having 15% off of all purchases! Those who are VIB rouges recieved 20% off
        their purchases. Although, I missed the sale this year, there are a couple 
        items I will be ordering online soon. The first thing is I will be ordering
        is another Nars Skin Tint foundation. I will also be purchasing a foundation 
        from Fenty Beauty. I have heard their color range is fantastic and it is highly
        raved for being a natural foundation. I will also be purchasing the lipgloss 
        from the Fenty Beauty collection.

       I have been really loving my go to look at the moment. When I am in the mood
       to put on makeup but I do not want a full face of makeup, I will do the following. 
       I will fill in my eyebrows with a dipbrow from Anastasia Beverly Hills. I will fill
       them in with slight strokes. I then use concealor in my T-zone area: the forehead, 
       under my eyes, the bridge of my nose, and finally my chin. I then will a little
       bronzer and highlight. Finally, I will apply some mascara, lipstick and powder
       the rest of my face with a translucent powder to set the concealor in place. This is
       my routine for natural every-day makeup.
